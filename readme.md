# `WebGPU API`

This repository will walk you thorugh the process of drawing 3D graphics on the browser unleashing the power of the GPU.

Also thorugh the code and examples you will learn how to use the GPU to process expensive calculations. So you will be confident implementing these concepts to improve the performance when working on:

- Artificial intelligence
- Deep learning
- Data Sience
- Criptocurrency (Blockchain technologies)
- Mathematic workloads
- 3D Graphics

WebGPU API has not release a stable version ( At the time being July/19/2022 ) and things are expected to change.

Currently, the code only runs on Chrome Canary. I tried to make it work in Ubuntu with Chromium but unfortunatelly I could not.

I have created different bersions of the code to get the same result as time goes on, it does not differ too much from old versions though.

***

This repository uses the following techs:

    1. Chrome Canary
    2. TypeScript
    3. Vite
    4. React
    5. WebGPU Google Chrome API

Let's start with a simple triangle.
